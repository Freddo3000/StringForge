It can load in `Stringtable.xml` files, add, edit, reorganise and delete entries, convert whole projects consisting out of multiple `Stringtable.csv` into single fragmented xml files.

The MVVM architectural pattern is utilized where possible but without the use of any perticular MVVM framework. Some advanced 3rd party libraries are used, such as ReactiveUI and Extended WPF Toolkit (CE) and GongSolutions dragndrop.\r\n\r\nThe tool is built and maintained by Alex Vorobiev.\r\n\r\n# Accreditation\r\n\r\nIcons used from: https://www.iconfinder.com/\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n- Key ID templates added\r\n- Model objects are now reactive, better reflecting updates\r\n- Improved Drag and Drop for the tree\r\n- Duplication of keys imporved\r\n- Some bug fixes\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n- Basing stringtable handling and conversion","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
